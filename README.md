# Snorlax - Thapar admission bot using Rasa

## üë∑‚Äç Installation

To install Sara, please clone the repo and run:

```sh
cd rasa-demo
make install
```

This will install the bot and all of its requirements.
Note that this bot should be used with python 3.6 or 3.7.


## ü§ñ To run Sara:

Use `rasa train` to train a model (this will take a significant amount of memory to train,
if you want to train it faster, try the training command with
`--augmentation 0`).

Then, to run, first set up your action server in one terminal window:
```bash
rasa run actions --actions actions.actions
```

## üë©‚Äçüíª Overview of the files

`data/core/` - contains stories 

`data/nlu` - contains NLU training data

`actions` - contains custom action code

`domain.yml` - the domain file, including bot response templates

`config.yml` - training configurations for the NLU pipeline and policy ensemble


## Development

To install requirements for development, run:

```sh
make install-dev
```

To run custom actions locally, put a file called .env in the root of your local directory with values
for the following environment variables. Most actions will work without them, but if you are working on actions
connecting to external APIs you will need credentials.
